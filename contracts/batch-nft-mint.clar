;; This Clarity contract manages the issuance, burning, and transferring of Digital Identity (DID) 
;; non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It provides the following functionalities:
;; 1. Minting single or batch NFTs with specified URIs.
;; 2. Updating token URIs.
;; 3. Transferring NFTs between principals.
;; 4. Burning NFTs with checks to ensure proper ownership and non-burned status.
;; 5. Read-only functions to retrieve token information like URI, owner, and burn status.
;;
;; The contract ensures that only the token owner can burn, transfer, or update the token URI. 
;; Additionally, it enforces limits on the batch minting size and ensures token URIs are valid before being set.
